# recon-sentinel
Firmware dump for the obscure device called "Recon Sentinel".
I copied all data from the supplied SD card from the RS using win32 Disk Imager.
It was seperated into 7 partitions of data.
I wasn't able to get much out of digging into the firmware, as I don't have much experience with embedded firmware development.
I'm hoping someone will find this useful.
