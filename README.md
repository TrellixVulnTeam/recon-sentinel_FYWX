# recon-sentinel
Firmware dump for an obscure network device called the "Recon Sentinel".
I copied all data from the supplied SD card from the RS using Kali Linux.
It was seperated into boot, and the linux filesystem.
I was able to get most of the filesystem, except symlinks.
I'm hoping someone will find this useful. It is very interesting stuff.
Most firmware for the actual device (python scripts) are located in /usr/local/bin

Here are some links to information about this interesting device:
